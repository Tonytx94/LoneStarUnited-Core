**Private Texas SNAP and Support Assistant for Texans**  
*Built by the people, for the people.*

## 🌟 Mission

LoneStar United is a grassroots initiative to revolutionize how Texans access public assistance—starting with food stamps (SNAP), healthcare, education, veteran support, and more. 

Our goal is simple: **end paper trails and bring help faster** to families in need. We believe no one should have to suffer because of slow systems or outdated processes. Through AI and automation, we’re modernizing how government support reaches the people of Texas—one digital solution at a time.

> “This is our home. Together, we grow it. It takes a village.”  
> — Anthony Nichols, Founder

## 💡 Why It Matters

Founder **Anthony Nichols**, a Black Hispanic American from San Antonio, grew up witnessing the struggles of families needing help. After losing his father at a young age, government programs became his lifeline. Now, he’s using technology to return the favor—to make sure no one has to fight a broken system just to survive.

This project was built with:
- Lived experience
- Love for Texas
- The belief that **technology should serve the people, not slow them down**
